Amazon Simple Service Storage Classess Deep Live

-in this lession we are able to indentify that for our data whcih storage class is more suitable.
-in this each storage classess offers different storage minimum object size limits, storage duration, cost structure, lifecycle management, and retrieval times. 
-there are 8 different types of storage classess.
-Durability ::
	-Amazon S3 maintains unmatched durability by creating copies of an object and storing it across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a single AWS Region.
	-AZ (Availability Zones )
	-3 or more AZ in a Single AWS Region
	-each AZ sepreated by minimum 1km and maximum 100km.
-below is 7 storage classess ::
	-standard
	-intelligent tiering
	-standard-IA
	-one zone-IA
	-glacier instant retrieval
	-glacier flexible retrieval
	-glacier deep archieve
-Data Organization ::
	-a non-hierarchical strucuture and various management features to help for organize data.
	-all object can be organized with shared names called prefixes.
	-Using S3 object tags allow you to add up to 10 key-value pairs to each object, and you can modify and update these tags throughout an object’s lifecycle
-Lifecycle management ::
	-Amazon S3 allows for both automated and manual movement of data.
	-For automated data movement, you can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering, which monitors your data and access patterns and then automatically moves data from a more expensive frequently accessed tier to a less expensive infrequently accessed tier. 
	-For manual movement and more granular control over data movement, you can use an Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration, which is a set of rules defining different actions to apply to a group of objects.
-what if my storage class fills up ?
	-Amazon S3 is a simple key-value store designed to store as many objects as you want. You store these objects in one or more buckets, and each individual object can be up to 5 TB in size. Because of the resilient and durable architecture of AWS and Amazon S3, you will not run out of space in your buckets. Amazon S3 will hold as many objects as you require.
-Amazon S3 inventory reports ::
	-To keep track of objects and their respective tags, buckets, and prefixes, you can use an S3 inventory report that lists your stored objects within an S3 bucket or with a specific prefix, and their respective metadata and encryption status.
	-S3 inventory can be configured to generate reports on a daily or a weekly basis.

Storage Classes for Frequently Accessed Data ::

-Amazon S3 Standard (general purpose)::
	-Amazon S3 Standard is the default storage class for Amazon S3 and is automatically assigned to your objects if you do not choose a different storage class.
	-Amazon S3 Standard is designed for performance-sensitive use cases, those that require millisecond access time, and for your most frequently accessed data.

-Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access ::
	-Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is for data that you access less frequently, but for which you require rapid access when you do need it.
	-S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per-GB storage price and per-GB retrieval fee. 
	-This combination of low cost and high performance make S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and data stores for disaster recovery files. 
	-S3 Standard IA stores objects redundantly across multiple Availability Zones so that objects are resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone.

Storage Classes for Unknown or Changing Access ::

-Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering ::
	-The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class optimizes storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
	-It is the only cloud storage that delivers automatic cost savings by moving data on a granular object level between access tiers when access patterns change.
	-This is the perfect storage class when you want to optimize storage costs for data that has unknown or changing access patterns.
	-There are no retrieval fees for S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
	-There is a small monthly object monitoring and automation fee, as S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors the access patterns and moves the objects automatically from one tier to another. This monthly fee does not apply for objects less than 128 KB.
	-How it works ?
		-Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering uses your data access patterns to automatically move data between three access tiers, with the option to activate a fourth and fifth archive and deep archival tier.
		-The first tier is optimized for frequent Access, the next lower-cost tier is optimized for infrequent Access, and the Archive Instant Access tier is a even lower-cost tier optimized for rarely accessed data. 
		-Additionally, there are two archive tiers that must be activated before using. Once activated, S3 Intelligent Tiering moves data that has not been accessed for 90+ consecutive day to the the Archive Access tier.
		-This tier has the same performance as the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class.
		-The last, optional tier, is the Deep Archive Access tier.
		-Once activated, objects that have not been access for 180 days automatically move to this lowest cost tier. This tier has the same performance as the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.
		-Objects uploaded or transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the Frequent Access tier.
		-S3 Intelligent-Tiering works by monitoring access patterns and then moving the objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the Infrequent Access tier.
		-Once you have activated one or both of the archive access tiers, S3 Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move objects that haven’t been accessed for 90 consecutive days to the Archive Access tier and then after 180 consecutive days of no access to the Deep Archive Access tier. 
		-If the objects are accessed at a later date, S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves the objects back to the Frequent Access tier.
		-There are no retrieval fees, so you won’t see unexpected increases in storage bills when access patterns change.
